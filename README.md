@aaronhendry -- Dr. Aaron Hendry, physicist at large

I do space physics and space physics related things.

Don't ask me about:

rocks

troll’s with sticks

All sorts of dragons

Mrs. Cake

Huje green things with teeth

Any kinds of black dogs with orange eyebrows

Rains of spaniel’s.

fog.

Mrs. Cake
